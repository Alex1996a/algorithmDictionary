Combination Sum 2

Given a collection of candidate numbers C and a target number(T).

find all unique combinations in C where the candidate numbers sums to T.
Each number in C may only be user once in the combination.

Have you met this question in a real interview ? Yes

Example 
For example , givencandidate set 10, 1, 6, 7, 2, 1,5 and target 8, 

A solution set is:
[1,7] [1, 2, 5]

Note 
All numbers (includeing target) wiil be positive integers

The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations
