Given a binary tree , find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root

node down to the farthest leaf node.

Given a binary tree as follow.

DFS(stack), recorded the depth level! and renew it .
But the question is that how to recorded the level fo its nodes?

C++ version

* Definiton of TreeNode:
* class TreeNode{
* public:
*	int val;
*	TreeNode *lelf, * right;
*	TreeNode(int val) {
*		this->val = val;
*		this->left = this->right = NULL;
		}
	}
*

class Solution{
public:
	/**
	* @param root: The root of binary tree.
	* @return: An integer
	*/

	int maxDepth(TreeNode *root){
		if (NULL == root){
		
			return 0;
		}

	int left_depth = maxDepth(root-left);
	int right_depth = maxDepth(root->right);
	
	return max(left_depth, right_depth) + 1;
	}
};
