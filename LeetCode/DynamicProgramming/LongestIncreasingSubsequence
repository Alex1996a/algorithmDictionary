lintcode (76) Longest Increasing Subsequence

Dynamic Programming | set 3 (Longest Increasing Susequence) GeeksforGes

Given a sequence of integers find the longest increasing subsequence(LIs)

Time complexity O(n^2) or (nLongn)
what's the definiton of longest increasing subsequence?

* The longest incresing subsequence problem is to find a subsequence of
a given sequence in which the subsequence's elements are in sorted order,lowest to highest, and in which the subsequence is as long as possible
This subsequence is not necessarily contiguous , or unique!!

DP 


class Solution:

	"""
	@param nums The integer array 
	@return : The length of LIs (longest increasing subsequence)

	"""

	def longestIncreasingSubsequence(self, nums):

		if not nums:

			return 0

		lis = [1] * len(nums)

		for i in xrange(1, len(nums)):

			for j in xrange(i):

				if nums[j] <= nums[i] and list[i] < 1 + lis[j]:

					lis[i] = 1 + lis[j]

				return max(lis)
